/*
JavaScript code is executed directly by a JavaScript engine within a web browser or a runtime environment like Node.js. Major browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) have their own JavaScript engines:

- Chrome uses the V8 engine.
- Safari uses the JavaScriptCore engine, also known as Nitro.
- Edge uses the Chakra engine, though newer versions use V8 as they are based on Chromium.

Node.js also uses the V8 engine for server-side JavaScript execution. These engines parse and execute JavaScript code directly, optimizing it on-the-fly to improve performance.
